# Ops Automation with Python

This section contains small Python scripts focused on automating
common operational and SRE-related tasks.

The goal is to practice using Python to:
- reduce manual operational work
- improve system visibility
- build simple, reliable automation

Each script is designed to solve a real-world problem
commonly encountered in production environments.
